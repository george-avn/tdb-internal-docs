# General Rules

- Packs are only permissible for TV/Season Series. Movie Packs are not permitted.
- All packs must contain only a single season. No entire series packs permitted.
- Individual episodes should only be released while a current season is running. After the season is complete, only packs should be released.
- “Extras'' are defined as separate video tracks. They are not included with encodes or remuxes and are released separately
- MediaInfo must be included on all submissions. MediaInfo 20.09 is to be used in the “Text” view
- TDB requires thumbnails on all video uploads. The requirements for thumbnails are the same for both Remuxes and Encodes.

## Thumbnail Requirements

- 8 Thumbnails should be provided.
- Credits and logos should not be included in thumbnails.
- Thumbnails should be in the original resolution/aspect ratio of the remux or encode.
- Sources which contain a wide color gamut (10 bit) should have matching wide color gamut (10 bit) thumbnails. In other words, the thumbnails should not appear washed out
- Thumbnails should be in the PNG file format.
- Thumbnails should be grabbed using the ScreenGrabber from PewPew


## Checklists & Record Keeping

As part of any release, the corresponding Remux or Encode checklist must be completed. This checklist must be completed after all steps of the remux or encode are completed and the release is pending submission. If after completing the checklist, no changes are found, the release can be submitted. If changes are found, once the changes are addressed, the checklist must be completed once again, from the beginning.

Any changes to the Remux or Encoding checklist are considered version changes to this document and are subject to the same rules and expectations as changes to this document.
