This is the home of the HYPER team. The HYPER team is dedicated to releasing high quality content in the Full Disc, Remux and Encoded formats from resolutions of 480i to 2160p. We aim to strike a balance between obsessive time-consuming requirements and practical needs. Remuxes aim to provide a wide variety of content at consistent, reproducible standards that are suitable both for consumption as well as a source for encoding. Remuxes do not attempt to balance quality against size. Encodes aim to provide the most attuned compromise between quality and file size. Encodes do not attempt to be the “fastest” release or the smallest release. Full Discs aim to be an exact replica of the disc in the BDMV folder structure

The ability to provide a consistent and expectable output is second only to the quality of the output itself. This is doubly so in the case of Remuxes. Remuxes aim to have no subjective component and aim to provide the same content regardless of the Remuxer, given the same source. To this end, strict attention to detail and adherence to defined processes are required to provide the consistency required. Anyone committing to releasing as part of the HYPER team similarly commits to the same level of adherence. Failure to do so will result in the revoking of release privileges.

### Version Control

This document is version controlled. Any change to the formatting, but not the content is a change to the “dot” version and does not need any approval. For example, consolidating two sections into one would cause the version to go from 1.0 to 1.1. Any changes to the requirements themselves, be it adding or removing an internal team member, a new requirement, the removal of a requirement or a tweak of an existing requirement would require a version change and approval. For example, changing the naming convention of the Video track would cause a change from 1.1 to 2.0. Approval is constituted as one of the following:

1.  Approval from Creator
2.  A majority vote of all internal members (more than half)
3.  A plurality of all votes cast for a period lasting 7 days from the initial request to vote (more than competing votes)

## Internal Team

These are members who are eligible for releasing as part of the HYPERbit or HYPERbyte tags. They are also eligible for voting on updates to the Remuxing and Encoding guidelines for each tag. Adding or removing members requires approval as spelled out in the [Version Control](#h.6535x74iwas2) section.
